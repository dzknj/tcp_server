This is my TCP server creator and tester README.md file.

My server.js creates a server on Local port 3000.

It notifies user of the port the server is on, in the console.

It takes any request and displays it in the console of the node process.

The test checks if the file created by server has data and;

The test checks to see if data from server matches that from the test.
