This is the readme file for the server creator. I am able to get files to be created for each process, or each time i press enter when running the file, but the first file never contains any data and also the most recent created file will contain only the most recent stdin from the keyboard and each one before the most recent file will automatically be updated with anything added after it was created but not what was there before. It is mind boggling, and im sure im doing this in a weird way, but i cant seem to figure this out. and it really bothers me that the most recent created file will be empty
